vim-toys
========

vim-toys is a fully configured .vim directory intended to allow *me*
to feel comfortable in the vim editor.

It is neither organised nor intended to be consumed verbatim.

Instead you should either ignore it and go and read something
more interesting or you should use it as inspiration. Treat it
as a collection of ideas to be plundered rather than as a
functional work.

Quickstart
----------

  git clone git@github.com:daniel-thompson/toys-vim.git ~/.vim
  cd ~/.vim
  git submodule init
  git submodule update
